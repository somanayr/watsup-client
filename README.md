# watsup-client
Browser extension implementation of the WATSUP protocol

Server can be found [here](https://github.com/gwgundersen/watsup)

This is designed as a proof of concept. A full implementation would require a lot of spoof protection, which this isn't designed to do very thoroughly. Instead, we aim to show our protocol works as intended.
